# A model based approach to testing Neovim's mode transitions

**Abstract:**

Modal text editors, like Vi and its derivatives, support different editing modes, each based around distinct tasks and each having a different set of keybindings. Reusing keys like this leads to a more efficient text editing workflow by decreasing the number of keystrokes required for frequent editing tasks. It is important for the modes and the transitions between them to be well defined and consistent. This study aims to present a model based approach to generating testcases that can verify the text mode transitions of Neovim.
